# The EXP-T program system 

The EXP-T program package is designed for high-precision modeling of molecular electronic structure using the relativistic Fock space multireference coupled cluster method (FS-RCC). EXP-T is written from scratch in the C99 programming language and is currently focused on Unix-like systems.
