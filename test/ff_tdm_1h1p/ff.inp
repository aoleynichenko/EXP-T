file: HEFFM
#
#        file with one effective hamiltonian or a sequence of heff
#        e.g. heff for one field value,
#             heff for spin-orbit (nearly) switched off
#             simply heff you want to get the eigenstates
#             sequence you want to pade-extrapolate 
#        if you are doing ff transition moment calculations or 
#        so separation, you have to supply a second file,
#
#file: second_file_name (optional)
file: HEFFP
#
#             heff for another field value, or
#             heff for pin-orbit switched on,
#             respectively
#
sector: 0011
#
#       or 1h0p, 1h1p, 2h0p, 0h2p - the fock space sector you are 
#       interested in (heff files for higher sectors 
#       contain several heffs) 
#
rep: 1
#
#       (co)representation you want to see
#       e.g.  rep: 1 for fully symmetrical rep
#
main: 10
#
#     or main: <number1>-<number2> 
#
#       ff_tdm or one-point pade approximation: simply the number 
#       of lowest states or the range of states of given sector and
#       symmetry you want to see
#       
#       so separation, projected approximant construction:
#       subspace used for projection
#
#       e.g.   main: 10  (equivalently, main: 1-10)
#       or     main: 6-7
#
#       to perform pade extrapolation, you have to indicate
#
#[0/1]
#
#      (or [1/1], [0/2] etc; you should have L+M+2 heff's to
#       build the [L/M] approximant  
#
#       to cut off the states above "main:" subset before 
#       the extrapolation, indicate 
#       [0/1] cut
#
#
#
#       only to perform ff tdm calculations, add
#
#step: <step length> 
step: 0.00002
#
#       e.g. step: 0.00002
#       difference of field strenghts (a.u.) in two finite-field 
#       calculations. the presence of this line activated the
#       ff tdm calculation mode, if you do not need it, delete this line
#
#
#
#       only for so separation (quasidiabatiization) calculations, add
#  
#scale: <small number>
#
#       fraction of effective spin-orbit retained in "scalar"
#       calculations to get good relativistic symmetries
#       e.g. scale: 0.0001
#       delete this line if you do not want to diabatize anything
#
#
#
#ground: <energy in atomic units> (optional)
#
#       useful only when you have to compute energies with
#       respect to some state (normally ground) which belongs
#       to another rep or sector 
#
#
print: 1
#
#       print: 0 or print: 1 are normally ok; enlarging 
#       this number, you can get any amount of superfluous
#       information listed
#
#Bloch
#       activates the computation of finite-field
#       transition dipoles with Bloch effective Hamiltonian
#       eigenvectors. otherwise, ff computations are 
#       performed with des Cloizeaux effective Hamiltonian
#       eigenvectors
